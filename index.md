# Braden Rice

## About Me
I am a husband, a father of two, and an engineer who loves to take things apart to see how they work. I graduated from Brigham Young University - Idaho in 2020 with a BS in Computer Science.

My career is built on a foundation of automation and efficiency. From validating F-16 software at Hill AFB to managing large-scale factory automation systems at Micron, I have always gravitated toward roles where I can build tools that make complex systems run smoother.

I am a lifelong learner who stays on the cutting edge of technology—experimenting with Generative AI, Container Orchestration, and Cloud Architecture to find new ways to solve old problems.

## My Philosophy: "The Art of the Solvable"
In university, I took a course on Computational Theory where we defined the mathematical boundaries of what a computer can and cannot do. That class shaped my entire professional outlook: *"If a problem doesn't violate the fundamental laws of computation, it is solvable. The rest is just engineering."* I approach every blocker with this mindset. Whether it is a technical constraint or a process bottleneck, there is always a path to a solution.

## The Lab & Interests

### Cybersecurity & Network Defense
I maintain a home lab environment running Parrot OS to practice penetration testing and network hardening. I actively compete on HackTheBox to sharpen my understanding of security vulnerabilities.

### Mechanical Engineering
When I am not at a keyboard, I am usually in the garage. I have a passion for motorcycle restoration and modification, applying the same systems-thinking I use in code to physical mechanical design.

## Goals
I am looking for a role where I can think, innovate, and create. I thrive in environments that allow me to contribute original ideas and solve difficult problems. I am industry-agnostic; I love any field where technology can be used to drive improvement, whether that is in software development, manufacturing, or operations leadership.
