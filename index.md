# About Me
I am married and have two children. I graduated from 
Brigham Young University - Idaho in 2020 with a BS in Computer Science. 

Since then, I worked at Hill AFB in F-16 Automation Testing and then at
Micron in factory automation.

I always try to stay up to date on the latest technology including generative
AI companions, AI development, containers and container orchestration, leading 
cloud platforms, and cyber security.

# Projects
I have a Raspberry Pi that I enjoy turning into different things. I first got
it to implement a personal DNS service service that could be used to block ads
or other domains on my home network.

Now, it is running parrot os which I use to climb the ranks and learn 
cyber security from HackTheBox.com

# Anything is Possible

I took a computational theory class where we discussed the actual, proven
limitations of computers. If the task is anything less than that, than there
is a way to do it.

# Goals

I hope to never stop learning and gworing. I want to be in a job where I can
think and innovate and create. I love any field and any technology as long
as I can solve problems and contribute my own ideas
