# About Me
I am married and have one daughter. I graduated in 2020 with a BS in Computer
Science from Brigham Young University Idaho. 

## My thoughts about computers

I took a computational theory class where we discussed the actual, proven
limitations of computers. If the task is anything less than that, than there
is a way to do it.

## Goals

I hope to never stop learning and gworing. I want to be in a job where I can
think and innovate and create. I love any field and any technology as long
as I can solve problems and contribute my own ideas
